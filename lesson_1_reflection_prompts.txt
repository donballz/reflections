How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Shows what lines have changed

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Find mistakes quicker

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Git gives fewer versions to sort through. But you are more likely to lose work if something goes wrong.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git is focused on programming where you may have logical changes across multiple files. GD is focused on maximum backup flexibility.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Not too impressed here. Only get the commit message. No indication about what files changed by viewing the log.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You can be less cautious knowing you can always get back to origin

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Continue using it for my programming projects. I like the colors, thanks.
